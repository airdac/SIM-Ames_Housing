# The file contains some numeric variables (retain all of them) and many factors (restrict to 10 to reduce the effort).


```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Load the data
if(!is.null(dev.list())) dev.off()
rm(list = ls())

test = read.csv("test.csv")
train = read.csv("train.csv")
```


```{r}
# Import the necesary library

library(car)
library(missMDA)
```

**0. Preprocessing**

```{r}
# With the summary, we can see that there is 80 variables in total.
summary(test)
# And the name of each feature are below.
str(test)
# Analyzing all the feature will be an exhausting work. So there should be some way to reduce the dimensionality. According to the statement of this project, we should retain all the numerical variable and 10 categorical variable.

# The categorical variable are below

Categorical_val = c('MSSubClass',"MSZoning","Street","Alley","LotShape","LandContour","Utilities","LotConfig","LandSlope","Neighborhood","Condition1","Condition2","BldgType","HouseStyle","OverallQual","OverallCond","RoofStyle","RoofMatl","Exterior1st","Exterior2nd","MasVnrType","ExterQual","ExterCond","Foundation","BsmtQual","BsmtCond","BsmtExposure","BsmtFinType1","BsmtFinType2","Heating","HeatingQC","CentralAir","Electrical","KitchenQual","Functional","FireplaceQu","GarageType","GarageFinish","GarageQual","GarageCond","PavedDrive","PoolQC","Fence","MiscFeature","SaleType","SaleCondition")

# The numerical variable are

Numerical_val = c("LotFrontage","LotArea","MasVnrArea","BsmtFinSF1","BsmtFinSF2","BsmtUnfSF","TotalBsmtSF","1stFlrSF","2ndFlrSF","LowQualFinSF","GrLivArea","BsmtFullBath","BsmtHalfBath","FullBath","HalfBath","Bedroom","Kitchen","TotRmsAbvGrd","Fireplaces","GarageCars","GarageArea","WoodDeckSF","OpenPorchSF","EnclosedPorch","X3SsnPorch","ScreenPorch","PoolArea","MiscVal")

# And the date variable are

Date_val = c("YearBuilt","YearRemodAdd","GarageYrBlt","MoSold","YrSold")

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Fitting should take train sample only.**

```{r}

```


**2. Create factors for retained qualitative variables. Train and Test samples.**

```{r}

```


**3. Determine if the response variable (charges) has an acceptably normal distribution.**

```{r}

```


**4. Address tests to discard serial correlation.**

```{r}

```


**5. Detect univariant and multivariant outliers, errors and missing values (if any) and apply an imputation technique if needed.**

```{r}

```


**6. Preliminary exploratory analysis to describe observed relations has to be undertaken.**

```{r}

```


**7. If you can improve linear relations or limit the effect of influential data, you must consider suitable transformations for variables.**

```{r}

```


**8. Apart from the retained factor variables, you can consider other categorical variables that can be defined from categorized numeric variables. Do not forget to implement new variable definitions in the test sample.**

```{r}

```


**9. You must take into account possible interactions between categorical and numerical variables.**

```{r}

```


**10. When building the model, you should study the presence of multi-collinearity and try to reduce their impact on the model for easier interpretation. **

```{r}

```


**11. You should build the model using a technique for selecting variables (removing no significant predictors and/or stepwise selection of the best models).**

```{r}

```


**12.The validation of the model has to be done with graphs and / or suitable tests to verify model assumptions.**

```{r}

```


**13. You must include the study of unusual and / or influential data. **

```{r}

```


**14. The resulting model should be interpreted in terms of the relationships of selected predictors and its effect on the response variable. **

```{r}

```


**15. You have to apply your final model to the test sample and roughly assess forecasting capability.**

```{r}

```
